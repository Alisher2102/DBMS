Our group consists of people: Karimov Alisher and Maratula Temirlan. We chose the topic for our topic "University", the consequence of this was that we ourselves are students and have an idea of how the university works in the database. Our database consists of entities: students, scholarship students, paying students, professors, faculties, chickens, clubs, student groups, attendance, grades, hospital hostel. Each of the entities has attributes corresponding to each of the tables. Example: in essence, "Students" has such attributes as "Student ID", "First Name", "Last Name", "Course", "Major", "GPA", "Phone Number", "Club Name", "Grant Status" ". Next, we normalized those entities that violated the functional dependencies of BCNF, in connection with this, we made for them a table partition in which the functional dependencies no longer violated BCNF. Our table is functional so that the student can find his lesson schedule by student ID, as well as pay for his education inside. Professors have the opportunity to find the schedule of the lessons they will teach, including salary increases depending on student performance. Show the date of eviction of students who settled in the hostel. Change the name of the main person inside the clubs if he graduated, and much more. Our table has triggers that are triggered by certain deletions, data entry or data updates. The most important entity is "Students", thanks to which users can navigate with their IDs to any table in order to get the information they need. This table has many queries that link it together with other tables. The idea came to us obviously, due to the fact that we are students.
